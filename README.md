# Stochastic mathematical model for the estimation of long COVID in Washington state

Here we present our framework for the estimation of long COVID in Washington state through the use of a stochastic mathematical model coded in [odin](https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin/index.html) and executed through the programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Though this example has been created using data for Washington state, and the data we have available, the code is flexible and can adapt to the information you have available if correctly specified.

# Model basics

There are three main sections to using the model in this walkthrough, all found within the R folder.
1) Fitting the model to data
2) Running the model
3) Plotting results
