# Stochastic mathematical model for the estimation of long COVID in Washington state

Here we present our framework for the estimation of long COVID in Washington state through the use of a stochastic mathematical model coded in [odin](https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin/index.html) and executed through the programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org/). This repository contains the code to fit, run and plot the results of the model.

There are three main sections to using the model in this walkthrough, all found within the R folder.
1) Fitting the model to data
2) Running the model
3) Plotting results

# Fitting the model
